# S1monsAssembly4-VM-v2
In S1monsAssembly4 a heap was added, to allow dynamic memory allocation.
This heap is managed directly by the Virtual Machine

In addition to the heap, a plugin system has been put into place.
This system makes the environment more modular and easy to expand.
A plugin folder can be set with the "--PluginPath" call argument.
